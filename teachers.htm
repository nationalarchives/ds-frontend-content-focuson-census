<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>What is the Census?</b>
<br>
This section provides a clear introduction to the Census. The section finishes with an interactive quiz.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Why is it taken?</b>
<br>
This section looks at the history of Census taking in Britain and the wider world. It also finishes with an interactive quiz.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Using the Census
</b><br>
This section shows how the Census can be used to study local history and where you need to go to access the Census returns. It includes a full page of a Census return, which can be investigated column by column. There is a drag and drop activity in the 'professions' column.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Your Turn
</b><br>
This section has a case study of how to use Census returns. It begins with a Census map, focuses down to street level, then a photograph of the street. Some of the houses in the photograph can then be clicked on to reveal the Census return for that house. Once the Census return is visible, a set of questions appears alongside, that guide the user through interpreting the return, and lead them to reaching a conclusion about the occupants of the house.
